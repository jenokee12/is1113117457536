    <div class="soccer">
        <p>I have had a keen interest in soccer all my life, watching my Dad and two older 
        brothers playing. Also supporting Liverpool with them spending endless weekends on the couch
        watching matches. I began playing in primary school at lunch time with my classmates.
        I then joined my local soccer club Evergreen. I continued to play all through my 6 years of 
        secondary school. I continue to play with Evergreen's Womens 7-a-side team.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="camogie">
        <p>Camogie was never my strongest sport despite growing up in Kilkenny. I began playing with my 
        local club O'Loughlin Gaels in Kilkenny when i was 12. I then took up camogie in 4th year in school.
        While playing with the school i have attained 3 Leinster medals and 2 All-Ireland medals. I have played with 
        the Kilkenny u17 County Development Squad last year where we won the All-Ireland in Dublin.
        I continue to play with my home club and I also play with the UCC Senior B Camogie team.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="football">
        <p>Despite growing up in Kilkenny football has been a keen factor in my life growing up.
        In primary school football was equally as encouraged as football. A town club, Kilkenny City, was set up to 
        join all of the surrounding clubs due to the lack of numbers. We went on to win Division 4,
        Division 3 and Division 2 of the All-Ireland Feile Championships. I also played in various
        competitions with the county team. I continue to play with the UCC Senior B football team.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="athletics">
        <p>I was a member of my home club Kilkenny City Harriers. I used to take part in various cross-country events 
        and also in track and field where i used to compete in the 800m and also relay events. I have endless 
        leinster and all-ireland medals in my collection. Unfortunately growing up meant more responsibilities and
        less time for activites so i no longer continue to compete in athletics. 
        In my free-time i like to go running to keep fit.</p>
