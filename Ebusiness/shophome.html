      <p class="mission"> The Silver Lining Cloud Storage Initiative is committed to the adoption, growth and standardization of cloud storage 
      and cloud data services. We seek to promote interoperability and portability of data stored in the cloud. Our mission is simple: make the growing
      technology of cloud storage an asset for your business not a problem. Too many times we have seen other IT consulting firms recommend solutions that are
      not appropriate for the specific client’s business or will not take a business’ operations into their planning as they routinely bring 
      down an entire business while they perform routine maintenance on a server. That is unacceptable.</p>
