        <div class="paragraph">
        <p  style="font-family:helvetica; font-size: 30px" >Cloud Computing, in very simple terms, is a place where information technology(IT) resources 
        such as computer hardware, operating systems, networks, storage, databases, and even entire
        software applications are available instantly, on-demand</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-family:helvetica; font-size: 30px">By using cloud storage, you don't have to store the information on your own hard drive.
        Instead, you can access it from any location and download it onto any device of your choice,
        including laptops, tablets, or smartphones. You can also edit files, such as Word 
        documents or PowerPoint presentations, simultaneously with other users, making it easier to work 
        away from the office.</p>
