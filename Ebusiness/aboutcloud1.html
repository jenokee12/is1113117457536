            <p id="par1">Software as a service is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications 
            over the Internet, as a service.Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply
            access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.
            SalesForce is an example of a company that uses an Saas model.

             <p id="par2">Platform as a Service provides an enviroment to allow for users to create their 
             own web applications. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on 
             a cloud platform without the cost of buying and managing the underlying 
             hardware and software layers. One con of Paas is how it limits the user
             to tools provided by the Paas developer. Cloud9 operate as a Paas.

            <!-- IAAS -->
             <p id="par3">Infrastructure as a service is a form of cloud computing that provides 
             virtualized computing resources over the internet. A cloud provider hosts 
             the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, 
             storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer. Amazon
             is an example of an independent Iaas provider.

             <p id="par4">Communications as a Service is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be 
             leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP, instant messaging, collaboration 
             and videoconference applications. CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business 
             might not otherwise afford. Gmail is a common exmaple of Caas.
